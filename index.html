        <h1>Welcome to the home of JiGJAs</h1>

        <p>JiGjAS is a Melbourne-based soul jazz quartet built around the warm, gritty sound of the HAMMOND
 ORGAN. Along with Adrian Whitehead on Hammond Organ, the band features Gideon Brazil (tenor
saxophone), Jim Green (guitar), and Sonja Horbelt (drums). Together, they craft infectious grooves
inspired by the classic 1960s soul jazz era, blending deep swing, bluesy licks, and tight
improvisation. With rich textures, irresistible rhythm, and a fresh take on vintage sounds, JigJas
delivers high-energy sets that move both heart and feet. Perfect for lovers of groove, jazz, and
everything in between.</p>
